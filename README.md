# Water Distribution System üåä

A web-based interactive tool for simulating and optimizing water distribution networks. This project leverages **React-Vite**, **Vis.js**, and advanced algorithms to provide functionalities like graphical representation, leakage detection, and optimization of water flow.

## üìå Features

### 1. **Graphical Representation**
- Visualizes the water distribution network as a graph.
- **Nodes** represent junctions, sources, or endpoints with attributes like:
  - `label`: Name or identifier of the node.
  - `node_type`: Type of node (e.g., source, normal).
  - Source nodes include known values for pressure and velocity.
- **Edges** represent pipes with attributes like:
  - `label`: Pipe name or identifier.
  - `distance`: Distance/length of the pipe.
  - `flow rate`: Rate of water flow through the pipe.

### 2. **Leakage Detection**
- Detects leaks in the network by analyzing flow rate mismatches or pressure anomalies using **Bernoulli's theorem**.

### 3. **New Optimal MST Without Leakage**
- Uses **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)** algorithms to calculate an optimal network excluding problematic pipes.

### 4. **Pipe Optimization and Radius Calculation**
- Optimizes pipe dimensions based on flow rate and pressure difference.
- Calculates radius and flow capacity using **Bernoulli‚Äôs theorem** for efficient water distribution.
